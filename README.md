# ⚛️ Manage State with React, Redux & Recoil

This project demonstrates three different approaches to state management in a React application:

- 🔁 **Redux** – Centralized and predictable global state container.
- 💥 **Recoil** – Modern and flexible state management with atoms and selectors.
- ⚛️ **React Native State** – Built-in state management using `useState` and `useContext`.
